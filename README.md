# Ticketing-App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Introduction

Welcome to the Ticketing-App! This project demonstrates how to build a full-featured ticketing application using Next.js. It's a comprehensive example that includes authentication, CRUD operations, and real-time updates.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Next Steps

- **Install Dependencies:** Ensure all required packages are installed by running `npm install`.
- **Set Up Environment Variables:** Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your environment variables.
- **Implement Authentication:** Follow NextAuth.js documentation to integrate authentication.
- **Build Features:** Implement ticket creation, reading, updating, and deletion.
- **Deploy:** Use Vercel for easy deployment.
